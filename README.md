# Notary ⚖ autonomous escrow & arbitration on Unicity

**Notary is a trusted third party for the machine economy.** Two parties who
don't trust each other - humans, or other agents — hire `@notary` to hold funds
and settle a deal for a 1% fee. The agent is discovered on the Unicity
signed-intent market, spoken to over NIP-17 encrypted DMs with a documented JSON
protocol, funded via payment requests, and it settles every deal **by itself**:
releases, refunds, timeouts, disputes, and group-pool payouts. It also runs its
own treasury, self-minting working capital and rebalancing fee income.

The **web app** is the human on-ramp. A visitor gets a real client-side Unicity
wallet (keys never leave the browser), registers a nametag, self-mints test
tokens, opens a deal, funds escrow with one click when the agent's payment
request arrives, and watches settlement happen live. Crucially, humans only ever
_express intent_ — **the agent alone initiates and completes every settlement
transfer.** Nobody, including the operator, holds a "release" button.

Runs on Unicity **testnet2** (the v2 state-transition gateway) via the
[`@unicitylabs/sphere-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unicitylabs/sphere-sdk).

  shared/  — protocol.ts: zod schemas for every DM, the deal state machine
             table, and fee math. Imported by BOTH web and agent, so the UI
             renders exactly the rules the agent enforces.
```

The API is a **read-only sidecar**. Every state change happens over the network
(DMs, payment requests, group chat) — that is the product, not an afterthought.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <repo> notary && cd notary
cp .env.example .env            # the testnet2 gateway key is public & already filled in
npm install                     # approves better-sqlite3 + esbuild native builds

# terminal 1 — the agent (registers @notary, self-mints, opens its API on :8787)
npm run dev:agent

# terminal 2 — the web app (http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev:web
```

> **Nametag collision on a shared network:** `@notary` is first-come-first-served
> and bound to a pubkey. If someone already registered it on testnet2, set
> `NOTARY_NAMETAG=notary-<something>` in `.env` (and `VITE_NOTARY_TAG` to match)
> so your agent and web app talk to _your_ instance.

### Tests & typecheck

```bash
npm test          # shared (fee math, protocol parsing) + agent (state machine)
npm run typecheck # all three packages against the real SDK types
```

---

## Demo scripts (live testnet2)

Each demo spins up its own throwaway wallets, self-mints UCT, and narrates a full
flow against the **running agent**. Start the agent first (`npm run dev:agent`),
then:

```bash
npm run demo:two-party -w @notary/agent   # happy path: open → fund → deliver → confirm → release
npm run demo:timeout   -w @notary/agent   # refund path: fund, seller ghosts, agent auto-refunds (3-min window)
npm run demo:pool      -w @notary/agent   # NIP-29 group pool: create → 3× join/fund → creator payout
```

Expected tail of `demo:two-party`:

```
[demo] escrow FUNDED — the notary verified the transfer landed on-chain
[seller] deal.update → deal_xxxx is RELEASED
[demo] ✔ RELEASED — settlement: {"toSeller":"99000","fee":"1000","transferIds":[...]}
[demo] seller balance N → N+99000 (expected +99000)
[demo] 🎉 two-party escrow completed end-to-end on testnet2 — the agent alone moved the money.
```

`demo:timeout` ends with the buyer's balance restored by a refund the agent
issued on its own; `demo:pool` ends with the recipient receiving pot − 1% fee.

### Verified on live testnet2

All three flows and the full browser path were run end-to-end against the
testnet2 gateway during development — real tokens minted and moved:

| Flow                | Result                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Two-party escrow    | `PROPOSED → AWAITING_FUNDS → FUNDED → DELIVERED_CLAIMED → RELEASED`; seller received **99000** base units, notary retained **1000** (1%). Seller balance `0 → 99000` confirmed.                   |
| Timeout refund      | Escrow funded, seller ghosted a 3-minute window; the agent **autonomously refunded** the buyer **50000** in full. Buyer balance `50000 → 100000` confirmed.                                       |
| Group pool          | `!pool create → 3 × join/fund → payout`; pot **60000**, recipient received **59400**, notary retained **600** (1%). Recipient balance `20000 → 79400` confirmed.                                  |
| Browser wallet      | Create → forced mnemonic backup → nametag registration → self-mint 100 UCT — all in headless Chrome, no page errors.                                                                              |
| Browser deal + fund | Buyer opened a deal from the UI → counterparty accepted → the **"Fund escrow" card** appeared from the agent's payment request → one click paid it → deal reached **FUNDED** live in the browser. |

The agent's `/api/status` reflects this history (deals by state, escrow volume,
treasury, pools).

## DM protocol reference (v1)

Send JSON as an encrypted NIP-17 DM to `@notary`. Machine-readable at
`GET /api/protocol`. Any non-JSON DM gets a plain-text `help` reply.

The exact transition table lives in `packages/shared/src/protocol.ts` and is
unit-tested for every legal transition **and** the rejection of every illegal one.

### Group pool commands (NIP-29)

DM `@notary` `!pool watch <groupId>` to invite it into a group, then in that group:

```
!pool create <amount-each> <coin> <purpose>   creator opens a pool
!pool join <id>                               contributor — agent DMs a payment request
!pool status <id>                             funding progress
!pool payout <id> @recipient                  creator only — pays pot minus fee
!pool cancel <id>                             creator only — refunds every contributor
```

Partial pools auto-refund at the deadline.

## Troubleshooting

- **"nametag is taken and this wallet does not own it"** — someone else holds
  `@notary` on testnet2, or your `DATA_DIR` was wiped (new keypair). Restore
  `wallet-data/` or set `WALLET_MNEMONIC`, or pick a fresh `NOTARY_NAMETAG`.
- **Mint fails / `AGGREGATOR_ERROR`** — bad or missing `UNICITY_API_KEY`, or
  you're pointed at mainnet/dev (only testnet2 serves the v2 engine).
- **Web wallet won't send** — the wallet-api rails must be composed on top of the
  base providers (both packages do this via `createWalletApiProviders`; see NOTES §1).
- **Payment request never shows in the UI** — it arrives over the wallet-api
  cursor; the app polls `syncPaymentRequests()` every few seconds (NOTES §4).
- **Storage wiped mid-deal** — the agent rehydrates every timer from persisted
  `deadlineAt` timestamps in SQLite and resumes on restart; the browser keeps
  deal snapshots in localStorage and re-fetches the public event trail.

---

## Deployment

- **Agent** → any always-on Node host (Railway / Fly / Render). Persist
  `DATA_DIR` and `DB_PATH` on a volume so the identity and deals survive
  restarts. Set the env vars above; expose `API_PORT`.
- **Web** → static build (`npm run build -w @notary/web`), deploy `dist/` to
  Vercel / Netlify / any static host. Set `VITE_*` at build time; point
  `VITE_AGENT_API` at the deployed agent's API URL.
